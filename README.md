# Overview
This project contains Python programming tasks focused on lambda expressions, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. I completed this assignment using Jupyter Notebook.

## Files Included
- `Assignment_3.html`: The main HTML file containing structured content and styles.
- `script.py`: A Python script implementing key programming exercises.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the necessary dependencies for running the Python scripts.

## How to Use
1. Open `Assignment_3.html` in a web browser.
2. Run `script.py` using Python in Jupyter Notebook or any preferred environment.
3. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` if needed.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
