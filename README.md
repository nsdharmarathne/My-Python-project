# My Previevs Python Projects
## Assignment 3

### Overview

The five Python programming tasks in this exercise focus on lambda expressions, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. I completed this assignment using Jupyter Notebook.

**Task Overview**

✅ Task 1: Lambda Function for Multiplication

Implemented a lambda function to multiply two numbers.

Demonstrates the power of anonymous functions in Python.

✅ Task 2: Function for Circle Area Calculation

Created a function that calculates the area of a circle given its radius.

Reinforces the use of mathematical formulas in functions.

✅ Task 3: Simple Calculator Function

Developed a basic calculator function that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Allows user input for operations.

✅ Task 4: Rectangle Class (OOP)

Implemented a Rectangle class with attributes for width and height.

Includes methods to calculate the area and perimeter.

✅ Task 5: Shape and Square Classes (OOP & Inheritance)

Created a base Shape class and derived a Square class from it.

Illustrates the principles of inheritance and polymorphism in OOP.
