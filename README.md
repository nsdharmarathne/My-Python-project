# Overview
This repository contains Python programming tasks that cover fundamental concepts such as user input, conditional statements, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP). These assignments were completed as part of my pathway program Introduction to computer science subject. 

## Task Overview

✅ **Task 1: Print a Name**  
A simple program that prints my full name to the console.

✅ **Task 2: Greeting with User Input**  
Takes a user's name as input and prints a personalized greeting.

✅ **Task 3: Sum of Two Numbers**  
Asks the user for two numbers, adds them together, and displays the result.

✅ **Task 4: Mathematical Operations**  
Performs addition, multiplication, and exponentiation based on predefined numbers.

✅ **Task 5: Password Generator**  
Generates a password using a user’s name, birth year, and age following a specific format.

✅ **Task 6: Even or Odd Checker**  
Determines if given numbers are even or odd and prints the appropriate message.

✅ **Task 7: Sum of Numbers Up to N**  
Calculates the sum of all numbers from 0 to a given integer input by the user.

✅ **Task 8: Number Guessing Game**  
A guessing game where the player must guess a randomly chosen number with hints.

✅ **Task 9: Multiplayer Number Guessing Game**  
Extends the previous game to support two players, comparing their attempts to determine the winner.

## How to Run
1. Open the Python files in a Python environment such as Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or any IDE.
2. Run the scripts to execute the solutions.
3. Follow the user input prompts for interactive tasks.
